# DeviceFinder

How can a blind person find its Bluetooth devices in an accessable and smooth way?
That's exactly the challenge this project wants to tackle by gamifying the whole proccess of locating the device.
In this sense, the proposed game takes inspiration from the famous children's game, hot and cold, this way having the user's phone giving active feedback about distance to the device. 
This feedback must be as much as possible tactile or sonorous, therefore, accessable to users with hearing disabilities.
